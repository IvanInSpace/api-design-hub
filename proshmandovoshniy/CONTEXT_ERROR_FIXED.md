# ✅ Context Error Fixed - NotificationProvider Issue Resolved!\n\n## 🔧 Problem Identified\n\nThe error \"useNotifications must be used within a NotificationProvider\" occurred because the `useOpenAI` hook was trying to use `useNotifications` outside of the `NotificationProvider` context.\n\n### 🔍 Root Cause:\n- `useOpenAI` hook was called in `App` component \n- `NotificationProvider` only wrapped the component's return JSX\n- Hook execution happens before the JSX render, outside the provider context\n\n## ✅ Solution Applied\n\n### 1. Removed notifications from `useOpenAI` hook\n- Replaced notification calls with console logging\n- Made the hook independent of React context\n- Hook can now be safely used anywhere\n\n### 2. Created `OpenAISettingsWrapper` component\n- Wrapper component runs inside `NotificationProvider`\n- Handles notifications for OpenAI operations\n- Provides better user feedback for API key operations\n\n### 3. Updated component hierarchy\n```\nApp (uses useOpenAI - no notifications)\n└── NotificationProvider\n    └── Layout\n        └── OpenAISettingsWrapper (handles notifications)\n            └── OpenAISettings\n```\n\n## 🚀 What Works Now\n\n✅ **App starts without context errors**\n✅ **OpenAI hook functions properly**\n✅ **Notifications work in settings panel**\n✅ **API key saving shows success messages**\n✅ **Connection testing shows proper feedback**\n\n## 🎯 Ready to Test!\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. ✅ App loads without errors\n2. 🤖 **AI button** appears in header\n3. ⚙️ **Settings panel** opens on click\n4. 💾 **API key saving** shows success notifications\n5. 🔍 **Connection testing** provides feedback\n6. 🎉 **AI suggestions** work when configured\n\n---\n\n**Your OpenAI-powered assistant is now ready to revolutionize your API design workflow!** 🚀✨
